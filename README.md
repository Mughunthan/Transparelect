# Transparelect
## The integrity and inclusivity of democratic elections are essential pillars of modern society. However, traditional Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) often face scrutiny due to concerns about security, transparency, and voter engagement. Our proposed EVM prototype combines the robust security of fingerprint authentication with the transparency of the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system. By incorporating a fingerprint sensor and face recognition for voter authentication, we aim to prevent instances of double voting and impersonation, thus bolstering the integrity of the electoral process. Moreover, our machine displays the selected candidate to the voter, mirroring the functionality of VVPAT, and thereby fostering trust and transparency. To achieve this, we leverage state-of-the-art technology, including a R307 fingerprint scanner, Arduino Uno microcontroller, GSM communication module(sim 800L), and OpenCV face recognition, this project offers a secure and transparent solution for authenticating registered voters during elections. Transparelect's core functionality begins with the integration of the R307 fingerprint scanner, enabling accurate and reliable identity verification. Once a voter's unique fingerprint has been captured, it is processed by the Arduino Uno board running custom firmware developed specifically for this application. The authenticated voter then proceeds to cast their ballot utilizing a user-friendly interface. After completing the voting process, the Arduino sends a confirmation message via GSM modem to the voter's mobile device, in order to encourage maximum participation in the joyous celebration of democracy in our nation. One of the primary benefits is that the voter is not required to physically carry a voter ID, as the system can automatically retrieve the necessary information from our fingerprint. To further enhance the capabilities of our system, Transparelect incorporates OpenCV face recognition technology for two purposes. Firstly, it provides double authentication, ensuring the integrity of the voting process, and promptly alerts the authorities if an individual attempts to vote multiple times. Secondly, it serves as an accessible alternative for individuals with disabilities, allowing them to cast their votes using face recognition technology. Our project not only prioritizes technological advancements, but also emphasizes the importance of fulfilling our civic duty to vote, thereby upholding our rights as citizens

##The Open CV software is employed for facial recognition purposes. Upon successful identification, a serial message 'a' is transmitted to the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE is linked to an Arduino Nano board which is interfaced with a relay. Subsequently, upon recognizing authorized faces, the relay is activated, thereby turning on the entire setup to enable voting.
