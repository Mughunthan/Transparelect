# Transparelect
## Transparelect's primary function starts with facial recognition. Once a successful identification is made, a serial message 'a' is sent to the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE is connected to an Arduino Nano board, which is then connected to a relay. Upon recognizing authorized faces, the relay is activated, thus powering up the entire setup for voting purposes. To ensure further authentication, the R307 fingerprint scanner is utilized. Once a voter's unique fingerprint is captured, it is processed by the Arduino Uno to activate the voting button mechanism. The authorized voter can then proceed to cast their ballot using a user-friendly interface or push buttons. After completing the voting process, the Arduino sends a confirmation message via the GSM module to the voter's mobile device, acknowledging their fulfillment of civic duty. In case a voter fails to vote, we have an election officer switching mechanism. By pressing the 5th button on the voting machine with their thumb fingerprint, the GSM module sends a message indicating their failure to vote. This approach aims to encourage maximum participation in the voting process.
